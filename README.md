## Implementation details

- **Layout** Throughout the project, I heavily relied on flexboxes, and ocassionally grid to manage the layout.

- **Positioning** I utilized absolute / relative positioning to handle some of the design aspects in a more convenient and seamless way.

- **Mixins** By declaring mixins for text, grid, padding, and such I facilitated the overall coding experience and avoided redundancy and repetitiveness.

- **Responsiveness** I was trying to replace fixed values with the relative-to-the-screen-size ones to enhance the responsiveness and overall look across different devices.

- **Framework** Thanks to React, I was able to avoid re-writing the same HTML blocks, and used loops and arrays with data to handle things more smoothly.

## Technologies used

- CreateReactApp
- HTML
- CSS (Sass)
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Redux.js

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, and I'm looking forward to my next projects with React.js!
